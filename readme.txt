Project: Color Flipper

followed freeCodeCamp.org youtube tutorial on this project in order to practice and get a better understanding of 
html and javascript. 

Idea of this project: A button that changes the background color of our body while also displaying what color we are using. 
There are two setups: 

Simple - uses a specific amount of color. fixed array with a fixed amount of colors. 
Hex -  generates hex color on the fly at random
